# rlComputerCraft
Some lua scripts for computer craft

For using it you need to remove .lua or use a class to import it.
The whole structure is a eclipse project for lua.

Also you can download the main APIs with my installer from Pastebin.
for that you need to enter in your ComputerCraft computer the following: 

```shell
pastebin get 6TdffH7q rlinstaller
rlinstaller
```
